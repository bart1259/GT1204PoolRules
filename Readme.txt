GT 1204 Pool Rules

Rules
1.	Participants
    1.1.	Players may play as individuals or as teams of even sizes.
    1.2.	If, when a game concludes, people are waiting in line to play, the winning side may continue playing while the losing side must defer the table to the next player/team in line.
2.	Break
    2.1.	If one side has won the previous game, they have the privilege of breaking.
        2.1.1.	 If neither side has won a previous game, the break will be determined by one player on each side to roll the cue ball off the far rail and attempt to bring it as close to the near rail as possible without touching it.
            2.1.1.1.	Sides may also simply agree to who will break.
    2.2.	On the break, the breaker may place the cue ball at any location within the kitchen.
    2.3.	To be considered a valid break, at least 3 balls must reach either a pocket or the kitchen.
        2.3.1.	If a ball rolls into the kitchen, bounces off the near wall, and rolls out, it is counted towards the 3 ball limit.
        2.3.2.	If the break is not valid, the opposing side may either re-rack and break again or they may play the table as-is. 
        2.3.2.1.	If the opposing side chooses to play the table as-is, it will be considered the same as if it were a normal break for other rules (particularly the “slop” rule).
    2.4.	If no balls are pocketed on the break, the table remains open and play proceeds to the next player on the opponent’s side.
    2.5.	If any balls are pocketed on the break, the breaker keeps their turn. 
        2.5.1.	If all balls pocketed are the same type, the breaker’s side will possess that type and the opponent’s side will possess the other type.
        2.5.2.	If there is at least one ball of both types pocketed, the table will remain open.
3.	Play
    3.1.	Once the break is complete, sides will compete to hit all the object balls of the type they possess into pockets.
    3.2.	On a player’s turn, they attempt to pocket an object ball of their type, unless the board is open. If the table is open, they attempt to pocket any object ball.
        3.2.1.	If they are successful, and the table was previously open, the side which pocketed the ball now possesses the type of the ball which was pocketed.
        3.2.2.	If they are successful, the player continues shooting unless a foul was committed (see Rule 5: Fouls)
4.	8-Ball
    4.1.	Once a side has pocketed all its object balls, it must pocket the 8-ball to win the game. 
    4.2.	If a player pockets the 8-ball prior to clearing all of their side’s object balls, their side loses the game.
    4.3.	If a player pockets the 8-ball after clearing all of their side’s object balls but commits a foul, their side loses the game.
    4.4.	If a player pockets the 8-ball after clearing all of their side’s object balls and commits no foul, their side wins the game.
    4.5.	A player may pocket the 8-ball on the same shot as the shot they clear their last object ball, provided:
        4.5.1.	The 8-ball is pocketed simultaneous to or after the last object ball
        4.5.2.	The player called the 8-ball before the shot.
    4.6.	However, if the player calls the 8-ball on his last shot and fails to sink it, they lose their turn.
    4.7.	If a player pockets the 8-ball on the break, the break shall be re-racked and redone by the same player, regardless of whether the cue ball is also pocketed.
5.	Fouls
    5.1.	A player commits a standard foul if, on their shot:
        5.1.1.	 The player scratches, by either pocketing the cue ball or causing it to jump over the rails and leave the table’s play area.
        5.1.2.	The player causes any object ball to jump over the rails and leave the table’s play area.
            5.1.2.1 If this event occurs, and the ball is of the player's type, the ball shall be returned to the table so that it touches the back rail opposite the kitchen as close as possible to the center dot.
            5.1.2.2 If this event occurs, and the ball is of the opposing side's type, the ball shall be considered to have been pocketed.
        5.1.3.	The cue ball hits an opponent’s object ball before any of theirs, unless:
            5.1.3.1.	Rule 5.1.4 has been suspended due to another rule
        5.1.4.	The cue ball does not contact at least one of the player’s own object balls
        5.1.5.	None of the player’s object balls are either pocketed or contact a rail
        5.1.6.	The player does not have at least one foot on the floor when their cue stick contacts the cue ball. 
        5.1.7.	The player touches any ball other than the cue ball with their cue stick, or any ball with anything other than the cue stick, unless the player has ball in hand.
            5.1.7.1.	If a player accidentally touches any ball illegally, it will not be considered a foul if they replace the ball to its previous location prior to taking a shot.
        5.1.8.	The player contacts the cue ball more than once on any given shot.
        5.1.9.	The player contacts the cue ball at the same time the cue ball contacts another ball, in the direction the cue ball is being driven.
            5.1.9.1.	If the cue ball is in contact with another ball before a shot is made, the player must shoot in a different direction than that of the contact. 
                5.1.9.1.1.	In the unlikely event that this cannot be done, due to 3 or more object balls being in contact with the cue ball, Rule 5.1.9 will be suspended, and there will be no foul.
        5.1.10.	The player commits a “push shot” where the contact to the cue ball is unnecessarily prolonged.
        5.1.11.	The player contacts any ball while balls on the table are still moving.
        5.1.12.	The player, having the opportunity to place the cue ball anywhere in the kitchen, shoots with the cue ball having any part extending beyond the kitchen.
        5.1.13.	The player, having the opportunity to place the cue ball anywhere in the kitchen, causes the cue ball to contact another ball, a rail, or a pocket that is located fully within that kitchen.
    5.2.	A player commits a serious foul if, on their shot:
        5.2.1.	The 8-ball is pocketed while their side still has object balls remaining on the table.
        5.2.2.	The player causes the 8-ball to jump over the rails and leave the table’s play area.
    5.3.	A player also commits a serious foul if they intentionally undertake any action that irreparably damages the status of the game, such as moving balls on the table with their hands.
        5.3.1.	If a player irreparably damages the status of the game intentionally, the opponent has the option of continuing the game as-is or declaring a draw.
6.	Slop
    6.1.	A player who shoots a ball of his own color commits slop unless they:
        6.1.1.	Call the ball and pocket the ball will land in
        6.1.2.	Perform an “Obvious Shot”
    6.2.	At any time before a player shoots, an opponent may ask him what his intended shot is, and he must answer, even if the shot would be obvious. In that case, Rule 6.1.2 would not apply.

Definitions
 Breaker: The player who is performing the break.
 Kitchen: The area behind the second dot on the end of the pool table where the cue ball is placed on the break. In some versions of pool this could be on either end, but in 8-ball pool this will be only on one end.
 Object ball: Any ball which is not the cue ball or the 8 ball. Object balls may belong to either your side or the opponent’s side. Object balls have one and only one type.
 Obvious Shot: A shot which hits a ball into a pocket where the cue ball hits the first ball that it strikes into a pocket and where the combination of the first ball hit and the cue ball prior to hitting the first ball contact at most one rail. Any actions the cue ball takes after striking the first ball or other balls which are pocketed are incidental, and would not be considered slop. 
 Open: If the table is “open” it means that neither side possesses a type.
 Play area: The area of the table lower than the rails where all the balls come to rest at the end of each shot unless a foul is committed.
 Possess: If a side were to “possess” a type, every object ball of that type would belong to that side.
 Side: One or more players working towards the same group of object balls.
 Type: Either solid or striped.
